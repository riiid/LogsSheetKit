## Usage

Usage of LogsSheetKit is pretty stright-forward, since LogsSheetKit handles most of the work by itself.

In order to log any message, just call LogsSheetManager.shared.log(message: "your message to be logged")

``` swift
        LogsSheetManager.shared.log(message: "Riiid!")
```

In order to open LogsSheetView, just present LogsSheet(), and that's it!
